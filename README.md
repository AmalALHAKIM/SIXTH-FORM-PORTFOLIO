# SIXTH-FORM-PORTFOLIO
This is my portfolio to prove that I can complete the Level 3 Computer Science A Level, despite not having taken the Computer Science GCSE.


Attached is a Python file I have coded, which I have created to showcase the skills I have developed through self-study as preparation for the A Level. The game consists of a:
  - Login section
  - Menu  section, leading to the 3 games:
    - Random Number Guessing Game
    - High Card, Low Card
    - Reaction Time Tester
I have incorporated many Python coding skills, including:
- Dictionaries
- While loops
- Sequence, selection and iteration
- Random number generation
- Time-based programming

When you first open the game, there is a login page. You are required to choose between the 2 usernames and passwords in order to access the rest of the code:

Login 1: 
  - Username = HelloWorld
  - Password = beginnerCoder

Login 2:
  - Username = RaspberryPi
  - Password = 3.14159

Along with this Python page, I have taken time to get accustomed to the Computer Science GCSE by completing self-study and practice papers over the past few months.
